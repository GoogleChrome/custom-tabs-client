This seems like quite a bit shift from the \"CustomTabsSession with Binder as ID\" concept and I am trying to wrap my head around the recommended flow here still. But I would say all clients using LauncherActivity launching as session with a hardcoded ID seems a bit problematic to begin with.",

      "message": "To be a bit more clear, my comment was on API usage, more than the implementation is working or not.\n\nnewSession() with two params seems to be a public method we have added, so a natural question is which API usage is recommended? (with an int given or not). If this is the only publicly visible example of its usage, then it gets a bit more confusing imo. Is there a way to have the internal implementation details not leak into the API surface this much?\n\nWhat happens if we make the default implementation of newSession(null) assign a single constant value internally at all times for the session integer ID? (That way we are keeping the API with a designated ID for cases where you are using multiple sessions and want to distinguish between the two).",
