      "message": "It seems a bit scary to me that we are recommending developers to use a helper class that sets the session id to some hardcoded ID.\n\nThis is the first time I had a chance to see the newSession implementation with an integer session ID. This seems like quite a bit shift from the \"CustomTabsSession with Binder as ID\" concept and I am trying to wrap my head around the recommended flow here still. But I would say all clients using LauncherActivity launching as session with a hardcoded ID seems a bit problematic to begin with.",
